review,sentiment
They are CP they feel that they own the city.,0
I can't rate it below than that.,0
 IT was just that I had to sit and eat their food because I was hungry and they treated me as if I was a ball in their court.,0
i feel as I was told that the owner has quite a few more eateries in the area.,0
The staff is full of attitude and humbleness is missing from their dictionary.Not sure what is missing in their hospitality,0
which airport provide hot snacks only after 0600 Hrs .. I always believed and told my friend you can not go wrong with ITC .. now I am forced to change that believe !!,0
"Why so many tourists were drawn here is beyond me.That being said, it's delhi, so you're always at a risk for Delhi Belly. Good luck!",0
food tasted like faeces.,0
"Waste of time, effort & money - will not go back in a long long time atleast till the reviews don get better.",0
I am absolutely shocked that this restaurant asks for a government Identification to use their wifi.,0
"The food which was appreciable were the salads only,the pizzas were...",0
the staff has the guts to refuse giving a loyal customer a simple side salad in place of unhealthy chips but doesn't have the guts to refuse customers from occupying tables and chairs for hours while their party is delayed in joining them. What sort of customer service is this... Instead of a herb dressing I requested a cesar dressing and three people came to me to refuse it. What committment..,0
Then we noticed the smell is coming form the sea food waste they throwing behind the restaurant which is worse than dog's dead body smell.,0
If you know mughlai food well.. This is not the place for you.,0
However we lost our appetite right at the entrance.Shame!,0
 Few of their dum managers will surely bring the brand down and could make some  of their regular people to avoid visiting them.,0
"The title sais everything, it looks nice and fancy but prices are high without better food quality.RUDE!!",0
"I am not sure if the management has noticed, but the experience at this place has gone down the drain.",0
Terrible ! Pathetic ! GROSS WASTE OF MONEY ! Never had such deplorable food .. I have kept it for the owner & chef to eat the same .. right before my eyes...have guests.. so cooking ..otherwise I would have physically brought it back.. Chef tomorrow be ready to taste your Horrible Food.. ,0
this place is joke...you can get anything and everything on a sizzler.This place has no ambience and is meant for families with screaming brats.,0
Ordered a chicken curry as a take away and it was absolutely worthless. The gravy seemed 4 days old and so did the chicken.,0
Karim's is one of the oldest and most famous restaurants in the area but what I found was nothing close to what I expected!,0
We were actually wondering why were we being served bad quality and tasteless food in a restaurant that has a very high rating.,0
Food was quite pathetic - everything looked like it had sat on the hot plate for a long while.,0
"They don't even serve the food, just leave it on the table.",0
"Perhaps because we are 'old', in our late 50s we were deemed in an inappropriate place and our custom unwanted.",0
Cooking is an art and cant be done with great equipment's only if you don't have it in you and that's the case with Leo's ... They have a beautiful stone pizza oven but don't know how to make a simple decent pizza + the cheese that they use looks like low quality Mozzarella as it turned out to be nothing less than a chewing gum.,0
HIGHLY OVERPRICED! Just can't figure out what were they charging for??,0
I found chicken in my veg curry.That in itself is a crime.,0
Pathetic waiting management. Also they are not as perfect as sarwana bhawan.,0
Hopeless service!!!  Hopeless service!  It was amazing till it was Biryani Paradise. ,0
You can have better food in other place will never again go to this place again.,0
We visited The Great Kabab Factory with a toddler yesterday and let me highlight what all was great-  1. No soap in ladies washroom- despite 3 times informing staff.Our dinner was ruined because I refused to eat with this kind of rude staff and my parents and husband kept waiting for food. My toddler had to be pacified with a phone.,0
I had one bite and couldn't take another.,0
Pathetic experience. Clueless wait staff.The owner should hire more professional staff.,0
Imagine you walk into a cafe and ask for coffee. The coffee comes not in the usual cup but in some funny disposable glass. You ask the waiter to help you with a cup- and he replies that cups are discontinued now! The next moment you get up to order something else and you find the entire staff of this particular cafe relishing coffee in a proper cup! The creepiest thing about franchised places like Cafe coffee day is the way their staff behaves! With absolutely no decent sense of respect for your guests - they pretend as if you did the most unwelcome and unpleasant thing by walking into their joint! CCD FOLKS- your snacks and coffee sucked anyways - now your staff sucks too! Way to go guys !,0
" I complained to the Hotel Manager, and asked for 'compensation' also (although that would not have helped in the mosquito bites), but he gently & cleverly sent me back.",0
Guys first time I am rating one star to taj property..sorry I didnt like food and service at capital reasturant . ,0
"when tried it was my life nightmare, worst food ever had, does not know to make Chicken tikka masala at all when said they just added some more spice in it and gave back.The most serious and unpleasant thing that would happen regarding food.",0
Never suggested to anyone and on what base they charge Service charges ???,0
" I have seen this happening at dhaba, but at this a pricey place (where cold drink is rs 140) - I would expect enough ice buckets at least.",0
Service was Pathetic. It appeared as if this place is not prepared to host people for a Saturday night.One of the worst experiences. ,0
It was served cold and i was wondering if i had actually ordered a frappe.,0
Specially the tea was so pathetic that i could stop myself and went back to the order counter give it back with my feedback that i get better tea in railway then your tea.,0
"We had the most horrible experience and the entire celebration mood was ruined .In case some one really needs to burn and waste their money , this is the perfect place for it .... horrible .",0
but the Nigiri Sushi needs improvement. You cannot serve plastic looking frozen sushi and expect customers to be happy when the sushi is falling apart.,0
we went for family lunch on sunday & for the first time we felt like uninvited guest at a restaurant.,0
"The manager appeared sorry, but still I had to tell him maybe it would be a good idea to remove the dish from the table. Anyway, we will never return here, not in the least because when you have 15 customers in your restaurant, maybe you can pay enough attention to their needs...",0
"The Dhaba Dinner was a Disaster, what killed it was not just the poor quality of food, appalling levels of service, huge delays, missing standards of guest experience, food, taste, temperature, service quality, but the indifferent attitude of the Manager and possibly ...maybe the colour RED !! ",0
"So this wannabe guy who looked mature comes to serve and with his unique style ,spills one of the drinks on me. All of us in high spirits left a very disappointing experience overall and felt way overcharged!!",0
 It might be good for foreigners but a person who knows about Indian dishes might not like it.,0
 Then when you sit you have to look and really beg someone to show you the menu.Horrible is the word to describe what i and most of the people got.The service and the behavior of people working here killed everything that night. I would not recommend or go to this restaurant ever in my life.,0
"Leaving food aside, there was no one even humble enough to serve a glass of water. It is very unpleasing and very shameful on the staff's and management's end.",0
"Absolutely a sham & No, No.",0
The chairs and tables are furnished in TARTAN (I have nothing against the Scottish but I don't think a Scotland would be amused if the George Cross was on display in a bar that says it's Scottish).The only way these people listen to genuine complaints is from the sound of your feet leaving!,0
 We had the Saturday lunch buffet and to say that we were disappointed would be an understatement.,0
Soggy boiled rice with few diced veggies was passed on as Fried Rice... Strange that with such poor food quality Yo china is still surviving....,0
For once trip advisor ditched me.,0
Well it all rubbish There a morning afternoon  and evening sachet and they are all the same and did nothing for me !!! Waste of money.,0
"I would recommend that you visit Swagath only if you must, and at your own risk. Avoid if you can.",0
I had ordered food from their GK outlet and it was horrible to say the least.,0
"First of all, except the doorman, no one was very keen to attend us.Visit at your own risk.",0
"It would have been great to have got some more substantial options for the price, or would have been much better off eating at a 5 star restaurant for a full meal for equal cost.",0
"Paying 7000 rupees for food that was inedible and mainly uneaten and whats more did not even enable me to fill my stomach is daylight robbery;My question to the team in charge is, what you up to guys?",0
"Of 8 days spent in Delhi and Gurgaon, it was the only meal that was truly disappointing.",0
" 2 pieces of very thin toast, 1 fried egg, 1 juice costs 130 rupee each! what the hell!",0
"A server called ""SAIF"" totally ruined our evening. His attitude was worse than what waiters in roadside dhabas would have.So people if you have an intense desire to be ill treated and misbehaved with then Sampan is the place for you. You will get served plenty of insults along with the food. ",0
"Dear Mr Khanna, thank you for letting me know, I didn realised I am so illiterate that I barely understood the difference of waiting area and cafe. My regards to your education, I learned something new. ",0
"Here, I learned the meaning of 'Frankenfood' - tasteless, plasticky/rubbery stuff that masquerades as food. Everything was so horrible that it was fascinating, and, amazingly, each dish cost as much as a similar item in a good restaurant.",0
"Totally DEVIL MAY CARE ATTITUDE prevails even after giving feedbacks via mail, tweeting or FB. Main reason seems to be most of the guests don't bother..!!!!!!! (Obviously...!!!!!!) As if all guests r SMALL CHILDREN!!!!!!!",0
"Staff there is not trained at all, they give you food as if they are giving it to a beggar....",0
 So yes I say if you have better options look elsewhere.,0
 I have never seen a place like this where all employees are frauds.,0
"How difficult is to get Indian good right? Seems difficult for sure Overrated and slow service  fit for small cars Indian cannot do anything well thought after, always penny wise pound foolish ... ",0
"Normally in India I gotten amazing food where ever I go, but this was big disappointment.",0
Totally disgusting.,0
it took the server more time to tell us what wasn available than what was ! ,0
"I can believe that in today environment & specially in the service/hospitality industry, and that too at a reasonably hi-end restaurant, I will get a govt. office type, bureaucratic, disinterested treatment.",0
The owner is simply minting money out of nothing.,0
"Food is dreadful! Kebabs which have a strange spice, chicken with a weird egg coating, no rice is served so you end up having dhal just floating on your plate ...The diners are mostly non Indians , a major tourist trap! really putting Indian food and hospitality to shame ! ",0
We found it absolutely shocking and frankly a bit horrifying that a restaurant in a Hyatt property is not held to the same standards that we have seen at every other Hyatt property we have stayed at anywhere else in the world. Absolutely terrible - NOT RECOMMENDED.,0
One of the unhygienic places i ever had food at .. Its just a name and nothing else . No taste and not even variety . Money wasted .. roadside food must be far better than this..,0
The quality of Chhole Bhature and tikki chhole was so bad that I had to leave it midway and on top of it I got stomachache.,0
Would never recommend this place to anyone.,0
To sum it up this place had all the pretense and none of the quality one would expect for such exhorbitant prices (even by North American standards). We felt very ripped off.,0
absolutely poor service level of staff.,0
The place plays music as though you are in a pub/discotheque not in a lounge. You can barely talk to each other.,0
"It is just name only, no authentic or even tasty food at all. Sambhar, Rasam and even Vegetables are totally tasteless. My rating -10. (Minus Ten)",0
"Everyone raves about this place but everything I've seen or tried there is worse than my laziest efforts in the kitchen, so many nicer places in khan market to eat don't waste your time.",0
"God is watching lol, you guys will pay for whatever stress and harrassment you guys did with me for sure  I strongly advice to skip, rest you can go and dare deny paying the service charge.",0
 That's the Bukhara for you. What a con job!!,0
"May I please present the one and only restaurant that has the perfect recipe for spoiling your evening.We had an experience so infinitely bad that the entire staff of this restaurant from the servers, cooks and manager all should be bundled and dumped in a hotel management school.The food that they serve is awefull in every sense of the term. I am running short of appropriate adjectives to express our displeasure. That evening we had our worst dining experience. May the owner of this restaurant and chef disappear in the dark dungeons they belong to.",0
basically everything we ordered was below average! ,0
"Tandoori Chicken was burnt and harder than rubber. Matar Paneer had Paneer which was fried to hell, again extremely hard and it tasted bad. So I really don't know if it was a bad day for me or for them or that's the reality now.",0
THEY ARE LIARS AND EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL.,0
Its waste of time and money if you are going for karims for your meal.,0
I never recommend anyone to go and waste Money & Time .,0
 Extremely average paneer dish oversold with a lot of drama around it .,0
We clearly fell in a tourist trap!  Our trip to India should not make us feel that we¡¯re constantly ripped off! Greediness does not get good reviews as it definitely does not mean returning customers! ,0
Only good thing is - Raita Vada Sambar sucks big time...,0
when we called them they claimed it to be totally vegetarian but there were 4-5 persons and no one ate it.,0
"Now, Yo!China is a waste of time and money. There's nothing in the food. You could be chewing anything hot - it mostly tastes flat.The best is to ignore it.",0
Do not eat poison rather eat the daal rice at your home as it is safe and secure.,0
"If i need to chew a galouti kebab for that long, how is it a galouti kebab?Four pieces of soya chaaps that are not even properly cooked, feels like you are eating raw chaaps.For this disastrous plate of absolute mess, they are charging 1000 bucks. ",0
Absolutely rubbish service! We were treated as if we were there for free food.,0
These liers and cheats should be taken to task.,0
 Am sure living in India we really can't do any thing about these things. ,0
Pull up or get out of the service industry. When will the customer have rights in this country.......?,0
i can easily vouch that a raod side vendor gives much better quality and his products taste much better. ,0
Despite being empty no one to serve The food was pathetic the service appalling  The order taker cum server was may be from different planet What cuisine was served I do not know but was not Thai The price was horrendous as if I was robbed on gun point.,0
"I am not a 5 star hotel fan when it comes to food, but Have never been to a worse Sunday brunch than this. The food tastes stale and is only there to fulfill you eye appetite.",0
We made the biggest mistake of our lives by going to Sagar for dinner.As if all North Indians are idiots and don't know what a drumstick looks like.,0
As if all North Indians are idiots and don't know what a drumstick looks like.,0
"NOTHING but hype is this place, useless and just worthless place to be.The whole staff is useless and just not considerate to your any need. ",0
"  Common, when we have so much good place to go ob Why TOS PUNJABI BAGH.Common, when we have so much good place to go ob Why TOS PUNJABI BAGH.",0
 I think the chef doesn't now how to cook food he was just giving kchha aloo as the famous BTW tikki.,0
This is our first visit to the cafe for lunch and i am pretty sure it was the last one. ,0
 Waiting time is like you are ordering from another planet. ,0
God oh god ... sugar took over totally over kaju and there was only traces of kaju coming in mouth.,0
"Kolkata style biryani has to be eaten fresh, I guess .",0
Most of the drinks are not avialable andalmostt wiatres were idiots. ,0
"Sorry but Not worth it to wait for more than an hour with young kids, I was expecting Good Food with Good Service but food is average nothing extraordinary  Food.",0
It's atrociously highly priced and better to save your hard earn money and spend it someplace else around delhi.,0
It's a bar and they don't have pint beers with how it can be possible.....,0
Today I home delivery from o curry. Chicken Kali Mirch was rs 470 and I feel like I have been cheated to greatest height.The taste was worse in my life.,0
No manners these two gentlemen had  I have never experienced such bad hospitality ever in my life and would make sure will never recommend this restaurant to anybody.,0
"I WENT TO THE MANAGER BUT HE DOES NOT WANT TO LISTEN ME, NOW U CAN THINK HOW MUCH IT WAS BAD  REALLY BAD BAD BAD AND JUST BAD EXPERIENCE.",0
 A great place to shop but a terrible place to eat.A rip-off. Delhi Belly is guaranteed!,0
The name is definitely emperor lounge but nothing else.,0
"The music was horribly loud, and, frankly the place is for young people with lots of money to blow away (almost certainly their parents' money).The management of this place needs to be trained and needs to learn elementary rules of courtesy and etiquette.",0
" However, the four of us found the food almost un-eatable.",0
 Although my friend who had ordered the Veg off the menu had a ball but me and my other non veg buddy were not that lucky.,0
Unfortunately this restaurant is connected to a very good hotel. Without that they wouldn't have a single customer.,0
" Thereafter another 30 minutes for mediocre food, pastas that were over cooked and a spice chicken which tasted like leather.",0
"Please be careful when paying this restaurant , don't get stung like us",0
If you are not looking to waste your money you can keep away from this place.,0
"Everytime I have visited this place, I have always prayed that this time would not be such a horrid affair with Bad Food and the Dirty way Food is served here in this Place. Better places use Great quality of disposable Environment friendly plates, cutlery BUT this place is a sorry Horror Story for Food and the way it is served. Anyways, this was my last try here. Waste, Cheat and an Insult to Food.",0
Even one star is too high. ,0
We could eat anything . Got the left overs packed n give it to a beggar at the signal . ,0
I am not sure what basis the bouncer was letting people in,0
We had a better meal the night after for less than Â£30 for four.,0
 They should get a great manager of the restaurant and the hotel.,0
As the food was inedible & tasted like as if it's been ordered from road side stalls.,0
"we finally got the change we should get, no excuses after all.",0
They certainly have no idea what is blackbean sauce and what is value-for-money.,0
I really don' t know why this restaurant is so famous!,0
On the whole  Order at your own Risk.,0
".Though party Hall was available, outside that, in the family area a child's birthday celebration was arranged with film songs played in very high volume.",0
he had no order receipts was working on his memory!!! While beers are cheap the whole attitude really is a downer.,0
"What cheek! 11,5 euro for 1 beer in a place of!!",0
 God only knows why anyone would go to the place.,0
Never going back again and strongly suggest no one else does that either.,0
"The only downside to the ITC Maurya hotel, was the meal at Dum Pukht.",0
"The first thing you notice is a deserted, rundown compound. The decor of the actual club is tired and absolutely filthy since it looks to be a night club in the evenings.",0
But after eating food here we caught infection and was put on antibiotics for 5 days really pathetic.,0
Bunch of senseless and irresponsible guys running the show Absolutely zero hospitality.,0
Tandoori momos were served with lots n lots of gravy as if we have ordered Manchurian.,0
creemy chicken lolipop had too much of cream in it that had to leave it after having one piece.,0
It's seems the TA ratings are doctored.,0
If you wanna have a good time just do not visit this place. ,0
This is not a 5 star flooding,0
Took ages to get served. Had a better time at the one in Kolkata.,0
Coke zero@250!!. More than a 5star.Very sorry for the sakley lovers. Appalling...,0
"Visited wow momo at Kashmere gate metro station.. absolutely hopeless restaurant.. unhygienic, stale momos served cold.. pepsi not cold.. don't waste your money & time.. avoid this spot",0
They did not even have basic courtesy.,0
"DISGUSTING, TERRIBLE AND OUTRAGEOUSLY FILTHY DO NOT VISIT FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY",0
If you want to spoil your mood this is the place to be.,0
The staff is so DUMB that you feel you're talking to Martians.,0
This outfit has old name but absolutely none of the old time quality.,0
Strongly recomend all not to visit this place.,0
the place was utterly hygienic and seating was cramped...,0
"Maybe other dishes still ok, but falafel is aweful!",0
I really don't get it. What's all the fuss about.,0
Being a chef of course I will cook better ,0
"If I wanted just food, i would have gone to the Hyatt - which is better, but i came to the Oberoi for the ambience, which unfortunately was totally missing.",0
"Have you heard the hindi saying of ""Unchi Dukaan, Fika Pakwan"".....Translated it says High Street with horrible food. And thats what The Ashok is all about.",0
" Guest doesn't matter to staff, manager or anybody.",0
Literally just name neither food nor drink is worthy for the cost they offer. ,0
There is so much tax on the food that it becomes amazingly expensive.,0
DO NOT EAT HERE,0
Waiters here are the RUDEST i have seen around the globe.,0
I'm sure the things the do have taste good but if something is unavailable for that long take it off the menu for God's sake.,0
"Half cooked rice , daal only water.....half cooked paratha. ",0
he was laughing instead of bein sorry for extreme poor servise,0
"The bar area was dingy, the other floor for family dining was too boring.",0
It's best you stay away and chose another place for your oriental food needs. ,0
"The food was only matched by the rude, abrupt and careless service.",0
Please ensure whenever you order keep buffer time else you will die WAITING.,0
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOU ARE GOING FOR FOOD ONLY. Nothing is good except if you like the atmosphere.,0
it really is quite a useless place. The Menu Card - scribbled & torn sheets of paper. The staff has no clue about what is included in the fixed menu for lunch.,0
"firstly washrooms(toilets) are just horrible sinking and not cleaned ,flushes not working. there is no provisin of drinking water as they never keep fresh glasses for water.",0
Extremely expensive place and no great ambience. Bukhara is 1000 times better place at ITC. Found flies inside the restaurant and restaurant provide 10% discount in compensating this for bill of 35k for 8 people.,0
the servers were so arrogant and hostile..it was like they were forced to serve us...they made sure of the fact that we felt quite unwelcomed in this hellhole which was a restaurant...,0
"If anyone wants to waste ur money and ur precious time, this is the perfect place then.",0
You have to wait and literally beg for your food . Moreover the staff is arrogant as if they are doing a favour to us by just talking !!,0
I have paid the amount for the full plate but received the half plate chili paneer.,0
A big rip off for one who knows what Peking Duck is.,0
Please visit if you do not mind throwing money on a restaurant which has rich name and fame and poor food quality.,0
Looks like will have to find some new brand serving best quality pastries and tarts.,0
They just want you to give away your money without appropriate services offered.,0

"If you would like to experience the 5 stages of grief and wait only about 45 minutes to get an incorrect order of a simple single scoop with 1 topping, then go to Mary Coyle.",0
 No attempt was given to make it even look good. No design.Needless to say I will not even dream of coming back here.,0
 $24 bucks literally in the trash can.DO NOT GET THE CEREAL MILK WHITE RUSSIAN.,0
I used to swear by this place.,0
I'm done throwing my money away.,0
I finished mine mostly out of spite and optimism.,0
The experience was like waking up excited for the last bit of your favorite cereal and pouring some cold clumpy sour milk in the bowl. Yeah it's that great.,0
Today again we had the same bad attitude towards us. ,0
Will never ever go nor recommend. Yuck yucky yuk.,0
The reason people think it is great and taste YUMMY as a lot of you call it is because your mind tricks you in thinking you are tasting something great since slice bread! ,0
"If you are a TV star specializing in baked goods, you are expected to deliver great quality and unique tasting foods.",0
 I'm not sure why this place is so popular and honestly I think campustown is better off without these cheats.,0
"Miserable, would describe her best, she should not work with the general public.",0
 I even asked if the corn was fresh but it isn't.,0
Shop is cute but doesn't house many really fresh items.,0
 When you charge $11 for a tiny slice of cheesecake you better be giving people the best cheesecake they had in their lives.,0
the cookies are like a store bought packaged cookie.,0
I can't believe it after watching the show thought this place would be amazing,0
" Sorry to say because it was good, pre mouse in the sprinkles window ( on YouTube) btw.",0
 I think a coffee shop should probably figure out how to have coffee at 8:30AM.,0
It seemed like the donuts had been out since the day before.,0
the rest are hard and chewy.,0
I got the SMALLEST AMOUNT OF ICE CREAM I will never go back.,0
"It was in one word, bland. As far as I know, this is the most expensive ice cream in Ohio but certainly not the best.",0
especially if u are another race and don't look like a million bucks!,0
Too bad because the staff was really nice and pleasant.,0
You should know the proper cook temperature for your baked goods or hire people that care about the food they're preparing. Will not come back to the bakery.,0
If you go stick to ice cream in a cup.,0
Going there was a mistake.I'll take Krispy Kreme over this place anytime.,0
 The patio seating in the back was fantastic but the donuts and coffee sadly ended up in the trash.,0
Thankfully I didn't have to wait in line.,0
It also leaves a taste in your mouth that you can't stand. Save your money and your taste buds and go get some Nestl Toll House cookies.,0
Have you las vegans lost your mind? How can you even call these macarons??,0
"Nothing special. Croissant tasted ""day old"".",0
I took one bite and it's still sitting on the counter my 7 year old granddaughter didn't even want it,0
 wtf? i drive all the way to venetian and this is what I get?,0
"With regards to the price, the portions are not proportional to what you pay.",0
I wish I could have tried Sweet Republic as it looked phenomenal when I stopped in.,0
"the people got two of our four orders wrong, but refused to remake them. They just looked at us, and kept saying ""no, this is what you ordered"".",0
What a charming place but goods are mostly not worth the money.,0
 Went there recently and it has gone downhill.,0
 6 employees yet it took more than 10 mins to get a simple order.,0
When a customer points out a flaw in service FIX it. I will not be back til they do!!,0
I meant to give it 5 stars. Not one debbie,0
i thought how can u mess that one up. Nope..same horrible texture.,0
"The lone girl working had such great vibe and smile, so this rating has nothing to do with her or the yummy looking desserts.",0
Sorry Fatty Daddy's but your gelato is too sweet - like it's made from a pre-made mix,0
I wish I had made a different choice.,0
I got a milkshake from there and the consistency of the shake was like water.,0
 The coffee is marginal and the baked goods... almost as good as the coffee.,0
"Not at all like them, looks like a run down gas station that just happens to serve ice cream and not gas.",0
I have tried almost every kind of coffee here and nothing tastes good.,0
" Usually they take great care into making it look good. Of late. Its been lopsided, uneven and ugly.",0
" Long lines, no where to sit, overpriced pastries, and service wasn't that great..",0
Blonde lady taking orders is rude and should not be representing your business,0
Mid at best.,0
Especially when I saw regular bread on display that you can buy at any local bakery at least here in california.,0
 Would skip this and just enjoy desert at one of the fine dining that is readily available in Vegas.,0
"Brownies were dry, strawberry shortcake was disgusting.",0
My kids didn't even eat their dessert.,0
"In a word, ""meh"".",0
It seems like just an overpriced Hipster type ice cream shop. I see no reason at all to go back there.,0
nope old as the Vegas strip.....molded as well just gross a cake full of moldy strawberries.....,0
I'm just disappointed with all the hype for nothing.,0
This Bakery is just novelty.,0
no menu for the coffee they can make....,0
I will still come to Jersey to try the real thing. Take more time on getting the taste down and not working about presenting it in a perfect box. ,0
 I think $14 slice of cake should be the best thing I have ever had for dessert and this just wasn't it. ,0
The pastries are not all that good and the place is so busy it's not the cleanest.,0
The only reason for the two stars is that we both had some tummy issues about an hour or so later and that was the last thing we ate. If it wasn't for that I would give another star. ,0
It's not the best location to have an ice cream cart. The top layer is literally melting. ,0
"Not serving on plates for dine-in customers, because ""too busy"" is not an excuse. Live what you preach ...",0
"It was not delicate as I had anticipated but rather bulky, chewy and on the stale side.",0
"Gilded. pretty on the outside, bland and cardboard on the inside. I'm talking w out their pastries here.",0
"The person who ""helped"" me out had an attitude the whole time. He acted like he was there against his will or something. ",0
"Great idea/concept, but it's just meh. ",0
"the graphic body parts decor was very unsettling and immediately disturbed my stomach,",0
The Uptown location tries to be 'lively and hip' but it comes off as plastic and busy.,0
" Variety is great, but I rather have freshness.",0
"But its like they they don't have a care in the world, they just take their time as if there's only one person to serve and not 20. Annoyed the entire time.",0
Tasted everything and was not impressed. ,0
However when you drop over $15 and you're treated like your inconviencing an employee it's unacceptable.,0
but alone it was just...cinnamon cake. Very disappointed. Not worth $4.25 or even what they charge in store.,0
I really tried to love this place but I'm not a fan. ,0
Dry donuts describes it best.,0
"this Tiara cashier, not friendly and apparently had a bad day, nothing friendly !! In the 4 times we have been here she's had a bad day ",0
The taste not worth all the hype.,0
I had the ice cream a year ago and got turned off by the counter service.,0
"While they were beautifully presented, once we bit into them, we noticed how dry and unexceptional that they are.",0
Had the blueberry with lemon icing...gross.,0
but there are some other places that are much better.,0
I loved the filling but for the price it just wasn't worth it.,0
Little hard to find in the sea of shops.,0
"I had to send back the food as it was cold, and things just didn't taste up to par.",0
